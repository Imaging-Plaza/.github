# Imaging Plaza

A unique project to simplify scientific imaging

Welcome to the Imaging Plaza - Your gateway to easy-to-use imaging software from across research domains and scales!

The Plaza offers FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) imaging software and codes that were meticulously selected to enhance visibility and accessibility to the research output of the imaging community, in Switzerland and beyond.

Unlike many other options, The Imaging Plaza isn't a code repository in itself â€“ it's a curated catalog tailored to help users confidently navigate the diverse array of imaging solutions available. With its intuitive AI-powered search features, our innovative "FAIR level" framework, and the providing of runnable examples, users can easily identify and access the most relevant tools for their research needs.

The Imaging Plaza is a joint endeavor by the EPFL Center for Imaging and the Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC). Its development was supported by an EPFL Open Science Grant and an ETH ORD Explore grant.
